== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin delete important content? =
No, Advanced Clean Master only deletes unused and redundant data. The plugin is designed with safety in mind and only removes content that is genuinely no longer needed, such as trashed posts, spam comments, auto-saved drafts, and orphaned media files not linked to any content. Your essential content remains completely safe.

= Can I schedule automatic cleanups? =
Yes! Advanced Clean Master offers both daily and weekly scheduling options. Simply visit the plugin dashboard and toggle the scheduling switches to enable automatic cleanups. This "set it and forget it" approach ensures your site stays optimized without manual intervention.

= Is it safe to use on a live website? =
Absolutely. Advanced Clean Master has been thoroughly tested on various WordPress configurations to ensure safety and reliability. The plugin only removes data that is genuinely unused, and all operations are performed with appropriate database transactions to prevent data corruption.

= Will this plugin speed up my WordPress site? =
Yes, by removing unnecessary data and optimizing database tables, Advanced Clean Master can significantly improve your site's performance. Cleaning up post revisions, transients, and optimizing database tables reduces database bloat, which leads to faster query execution and improved page load times.

= How much space can I expect to save? =
The amount of space saved depends on your site's specific situation. Sites with a long history, many revisions, or lots of media uploads typically see the most dramatic improvements. The plugin dashboard shows you exactly how much space you've saved through cleanup operations.

= What are auto-drafts and is it safe to delete them? =
Auto-drafts are automatically saved versions of posts that WordPress creates while you're editing content. These are different from regular drafts and are created every few seconds as a backup. Over time, these can accumulate and take up database space. It's completely safe to delete auto-drafts as they're only temporary backups and not your actual content.

= Does it work with WordPress multisite? =
Yes, Advanced Clean Master is fully compatible with WordPress multisite installations. It will clean and optimize each site in your network individually.

= Will this plugin help with SEO? =
Indirectly, yes. Faster websites tend to rank better in search engines, and by optimizing your database and cleaning unnecessary data, Advanced Clean Master helps improve your site's overall performance, which can positively impact your SEO efforts.

= How often should I run the cleanup tools? =
For most websites, a weekly cleanup schedule is sufficient. However, high-traffic sites with frequent content updates may benefit from daily cleanups. The plugin's scheduling feature makes it easy to set up the right frequency for your specific needs.

= Is Advanced Clean Master suitable for large websites? =  
Absolutely! Advanced Clean Masteris built for performance and safety, making it ideal for both small and large WordPress sites.

= Does it work with multisite installations? =  
Yes, Advanced Clean Masteris fully compatible with WordPress multisite.
